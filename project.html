            <h2>About the Academy</h2>
            <p>
                Skyborn Academy has trained the realm’s most skilled dragon riders for centuries. Nestled atop the
                ancient cliffs of Aeryndor, the academy stands as both a fortress and a sanctuary for those chosen to
                bond with the mighty winged guardians of the skies. Founded during the Age of Embers, when dragons first
                allied with humankind, Skyborn quickly rose to prominence as the most respected institution of aerial
                mastery.

                Over the ages, its halls have echoed with the footsteps of kings, war heroes, and legendary riders whose
                names are etched in the annals of history. The academy’s rigorous training blends ancient traditions
                with evolving techniques, ensuring that each graduate is not only a skilled rider, but a leader of honor
                and courage. To earn the title of Skyborn Rider is to hold a place among the elite — a symbol of
                prestige recognized across all the realms.
